# 11-2--Country-API

Another version of application using REST counties API.

Added search input (search by name or part of name). Results are matching within the database. Founded counties clickable. 

I was stringifying the objects and that includes the arrays as well for applying it to the page and customize it as needed

Unpretentious style included!
